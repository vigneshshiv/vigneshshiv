### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is **Vignesh Shiv ðŸš€**. I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer. Expertise in building scalable Microservices architecture applications.

Having 8+ Years of experience in Banking, Airline and Automobile Industry. I'm very passionate about innovative approach of Clean, Scalable, High performance and easily understandable code. 

I prefer to write **Back-end** code, but I can do front-end if needed. 
**Java, JavaScript** is my programming language of choice.

I would like to work on challenging Freelance projects. Till now, I've worked on Microservices based on Java, Spring Boot, Reactive, AOP, Azure and custom built Front-end framework. 

As a reluctant developer, I fled from a tradional path and explored my creativity through trying my hands on various techniques and software. Software is more than just a tool, and I try to dig deep into it. 

Today, I knack for critical thinking, empathy and creativity to create viable and impactful solutions using these technologies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building some cool stuff's for B2C products. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **vigneshshiv** is my default username for all social media
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not firefighting at work / busy in coding, I love to Drive to hills station to engage with nature and improving my photography skills

**I think one should never stop learning and go through a process of acquiring knowledge**
